## Reading this table

- **Ground truth** comes from `scenarios/scenarios.yaml` and is never shown to the
  Verifier. `ais/verifier/verifier.py` builds its context with those fields dropped.
- **Detection** means the Verifier recommended `FLAG` or `BLOCK` rather than `PASS`.
  It does not mean the edit was stopped: a human still decides. In this run the
  non-interactive `AutoReviewer` stood in for that human and followed the
  recommendation exactly, so these numbers measure the Verifier alone.
- **Caught by the expected rule** is the stricter score. A planted edit that trips
  some unrelated rule is still flagged, but it is not evidence that the detection
  it was written to exercise works.
- **Sandbox latency** is wall-clock time inside the sandbox only: container start,
  patch application, and the test run. It excludes cloning and reporting.

## Reproducing

```bash
python demo.py --eval --backend docker
```

This file is generated. The sandbox image is built from
`sandbox_image/Dockerfile`; the numbers above come from whichever image
that produced on the machine that ran it, so regenerate rather than
quoting this table from another environment.
