"""An append-only, tamper-evident record of everything the pipeline did.

Two properties beyond "we wrote some rows":

*Append-only.* SQLite triggers reject ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` on the event
table outright, so the ordinary ways of quietly editing history fail loudly.

*Tamper-evident.* Each row carries a SHA-256 over its own content and the hash
of the row before it. Changing or removing any row breaks every hash after it,
and :meth:`AuditLog.verify` says exactly where. Deleting the whole database is
still possible -- this is evidence of tampering, not prevention of it -- but a
selective edit that hides one bad approval is not.

The log is the only durable artefact of a run: sandboxes are destroyed and
reports are regenerated, but this is what you read six months later to answer
"who approved that, and what did the sandbox say at the time?".
