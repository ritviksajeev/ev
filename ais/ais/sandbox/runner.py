"""The sandbox entrypoint: apply the patch, run the tests, report what happened.

This script is the only thing the sandbox is asked to execute. It runs *inside*
the isolation boundary and is deliberately paranoid about its own reporting: a
crash, a timeout or an out-of-memory kill must still leave a readable result
behind, because "the sandbox produced nothing" is indistinguishable from "the
sandbox was fine" unless the runner says otherwise.

It is stdlib-only plus ``patchkit``, which is copied in beside it.
