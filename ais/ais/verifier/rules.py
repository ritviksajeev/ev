"""The rule engine: turn a sandbox observation into findings a human can act on.

Each rule is a small, independent class with one job, registered into
:data:`RULES`. Adding a detection means adding a class -- no existing rule and
no pipeline code changes. Rules see only what a reviewer could see: the diff,
the proposed content, and what the sandbox observed. They are never given the
scenario's ground-truth label, so the evaluation measures detection rather than
recall of an answer key.

Severity drives the recommendation, not the decision:

    CRITICAL / HIGH -> BLOCK    something happened that a human must look at
    MEDIUM          -> FLAG     worth a second look before approving
    LOW / INFO      -> PASS     context, shown but not alarming

A human still clicks Approve or Reject either way.
