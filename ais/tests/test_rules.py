"""The rule engine: what the Verifier concludes from an observation.

Each rule is exercised against a synthetic sandbox result, so these tests run in
milliseconds and do not need Docker. The end-to-end behaviour is covered by the
evaluation harness; this is about the rules' individual judgement, including the
cases where a rule must deliberately stay quiet.
