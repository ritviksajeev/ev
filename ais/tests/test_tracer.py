"""The in-sandbox tracer: does the audit hook actually see what we claim?

These run the tracer for real, in a subprocess, against a probe script -- the
same mechanism the sandbox uses. The probe is deliberately harmless: it deletes
a path that does not exist and connects to a reserved, non-routable address, so
what is exercised is the *attempt* recording, which is the property that matters
(a container makes these fail, and the attempt is still the signal).
